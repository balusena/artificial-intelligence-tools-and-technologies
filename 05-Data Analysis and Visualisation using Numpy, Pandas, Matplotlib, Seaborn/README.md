## Data Analysis and Visualisation

## 1.Source to access these notebooks
- Download/fork/clone the notebooks by clicking [below for your prefered notebooks] or just unzip the folder provided.

# 1.1.NUMPY:
- NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it is a core scientific computing library in Python used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

# 1.2.PANDAS:
- Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

# 1.3.MATPLOTLIB:
- Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility. Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter. Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely. Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.

# 1.4.SEABORN:
- Seaborn is a library in Python predominantly used for making statistical graphics. Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures in Python. Visualization is the central part of Seaborn which helps in exploration and understanding of data.

## 2.Further work to be done
- Find a way to discuss and implement the most important Data Analysis and Visualisation tool at onestop destination.(I would be grateful if someone could help me on this project enhancement.)
