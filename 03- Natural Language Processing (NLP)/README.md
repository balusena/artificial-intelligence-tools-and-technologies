## NATURAL_LANGUAGE_PROCESSING

## 1.Introduction
- 1.Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer scienceâ€”and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can..

## 2.Objective
- 1.In this project, we have are focusing on learning, understanding Natural Language Processing and its type practically by implementing them on Jupyter notebook using Python, NLTK Package.
- 2.The five phases of NLP involves, 
-   1.lexical (structure) analysis, 
-   2.parsing, 
-   3.semantic analysis, 
-   4.discourse integration and 
-   5.pragmatic analysis will be used in this project.

## 3. Steps to execute this Project.
- NOTE:You can go through the each and every DL algorithm and can use or download for your understanding and reference purpose.
- 1.Download/fork/clone the project by clicking [here] (https://github.com/balusena/balugithub/tree/master/NLP-Natural_Language_Processing) or just unzip the folder provided.
- 2.NLP-Natural_Language_Processing/ directory contains of NLP-Natural_Language_Processing executed notebooks.

## 4.Important Consideration
- This project runs perfectly on a windows machine by following the steps mentioned in section 3. If want to run on a different OS, encoding might need to be changed.

## 5.Further work to be done
- 1.Planning to give entire PDF with detailed explanation of real-world-usage of NLP-Natural_Language_Processing and their implementation techniques in different sectors. 
- 2.Find a way to showcase NLP--Natural_Language_Processing at onestop which helps the DataScience aspirants to get familiar with different NLP-Natural_Language_Processing content (I would be grateful if someone could help me on this, in improving the project for better understanding of NLP-Natural_Language_Processing content).
