## Fraud-detection-Insurance_Claims

## 1.project 
- We are developing various ML algorithm to detect the fraud claim. 
- This project has used the historical transaction data including normal transactions and fraud ones to obtain normal/fraud behavior features based on machine learning techniques, and utilized these features to check if a transaction is fraud or not. A comparative study has been conducted to decide which classifier is best for this project to train the behaviour features of normal and abnormal transactions.

## 2.Objective
- The objective is to construct a model to predict which transactions could be fraudulent with high accuracy.

## 3.Plan
- The data that we have is from Automobile Insurance company. We will be creating a predictive model that predicts if an insurance claim is fraudulent or not. The solution between YES/NO, is a Binary Classification task. A comparison study has been performed to understand which ML algorithm suits best to the dataset.

## 4.Steps to execute this Project.
- NOTE: Running the whole project might take an extended period of time. Training time also depends on your system's computation capabilities.
- 1. Download/fork/clone the project by clicking [here] (https://github.com/balusena/balugithub/tree/master/Fraud_Detection_Insurance) or just unzip the folder provided.
- 2. src/ directory contains the notebook with data prep and modelling code. 
- 3. In case you just want to see how the model is working, the model is provided in the models/ directory, load the model and go to the "Model Evaluation" section of the notebook and run the cells under that section.

## 5.Reports
- Report is available in the reports/ directory.

## 6.Important Consideration
- This project runs perfectly fine on a windows machine by following the steps mentioned in section 3. If want to run on a different OS, encoding might need to be changed.

## 7.Further work to be done
- 1.Planning to build a end-end web based fraud detection application using the HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT, Flask, or Strealit using Python and deploy it in Heroku, AWS Platforms. 
- 2.Find a way to detect the insurance fraud claims by using different machine learning models(I would be grateful if someone could help me on this, in improving the model for better results).
