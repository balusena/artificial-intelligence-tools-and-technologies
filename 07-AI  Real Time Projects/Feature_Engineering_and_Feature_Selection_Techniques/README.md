## Feature_Engineering_and_Feature_Selection_Techniques

## 1.Introduction
- There are 3 feature-related terms that sometimes are confused with each other. I will try and give summary explanation to each one of them in this project:
- 1.Feature extraction: Generation of features from data that are in a format that is difficult to analyse directly/are not directly comparable (e.g. images, time-series, etc.) In the example of a time-series, some simple features could be for example: length of time-series, period, mean value, std, etc.
- 2.Feature transformation: Transformation of existing features in order to create new ones based on the old ones. A very popularly used technique for dimensionality reduction is Principal Component Analysis (pca) that uses some orthogonal transformation in order to produce a set of linearly non-correlated variables based on the initial set of variables. 
- 3.Feature selection: Selection of the features with the highest "importance"/influence on the target variable, from a set of existing features. This can be done with various techniques: e.g. Linear Regression, Decision Trees, calculation of "importance" weights (e.g. Fisher score, ReliefF)
- The only thing we want to achieve is dimensionality reduction in an existing dataset, you can use either feature transformation or feature selection methods. But if we need to know the physical interpretation of the features we identify as "important" or we are trying to limit the amount of data that need to be collected for our analysis (we need all the initial set of features for feature transformation), then only feature selection can work.

## 2.Objective
- In this project, iam going to highlight the important Feature_Engineering_and_Feature_Selection_Techniques that are widely used in real time DataScience projects. 

## 3.Steps to execute this Project.
- NOTE: Running the whole project might take an extended period of time. Training time also depends on your system's computation capabilities.
- 1.Download/fork/clone the project by clicking [here] (https://github.com/balusena/balugithub/tree/master/Feature_Engineering_and_Feature_Selection_Techniques) or just unzip the folder provided.
- 2.Feature_Engineering_and_Feature_Selection_Techniques/ directory contains different types of ML algorithms executed notebooks.

## 4.Important Consideration
- This project runs perfectly on a windows machine by following the steps mentioned in section 3. If want to run on a different OS, encoding might need to be changed.

## 5.Further work to be done
- 1.Planning to give entire PDF with detailed explanation of different Feature_Engineering_and_Feature_Selection_Techniques and their implementations in different sectors.
- 2.Find a way to showcase widely used Feature_Engineering_and_Feature_Selection_Techniques at onestop which helps the DataScience aspirants to get familiar with differen Feature_Engineering_and_Feature_Selection_Techniques(I would be grateful if someone could help me on this, in improving the content for better understanding).
