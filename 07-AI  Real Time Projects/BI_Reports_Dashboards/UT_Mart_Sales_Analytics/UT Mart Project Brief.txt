Objective :
UT Discount Mart is a supermarket owned by UT GROUP.They want to build a BI dashboard where it can track how well Discount Mart is doing for this year 

(in terms of Sales,Profit and Quantity Sold),and also like to know how well categories are performing as well as different regions.They assumes that most

of the customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order but would like this confirmed by the data and also noted that Profit is 30% of the selling price.

They have given us csv files from which we have to create a Dashboard for quick review so that they can take further decisions for the benefit of the company.

Thus, we created below interactive dashboard as per his requirement. Now,they could switch and view different shipping stats for different months and years.
