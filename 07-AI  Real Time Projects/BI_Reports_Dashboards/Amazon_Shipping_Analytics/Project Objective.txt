Objective:

Amazon Trade is a company which ships a variety of FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) all over the world.

The Shipping Manager doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how many orders are processed and shipped on a monthly basis.

He need a dashboard where he selects a month and can tell how many orders are outstanding a day and where they need to be shipped.

Amazon Trade has a database on AWS as well as MySQL. The Shipping manager has given us the details to connect to it.
