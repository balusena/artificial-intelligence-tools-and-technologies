## Deep Learning Algorithms

## 1.Introduction
- 1.Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge. Deep learning is an important element of data science, which includes statistics and predictive modeling.

## 2.Objective
- In this project, we are focusing on learning, understanding Deep Laearning and its type practically by implementing them on Jupyter notebook using Python Tensorflow and Keras Deep Learning Packages. 

## 3.Steps to execute this Project.
- NOTE:You can go through the each and every DL algorithm and can use or download for your understanding and reference purpose.
- 1.Download/fork/clone the project by clicking [here] (https://github.com/balusena/balugithub/tree/master/Deep_Learning_Algorithms) or just unzip the folder provided.
- 2.Deep_Learning_Algorithms/ directory contains different types of ML algorithms executed notebooks.

## 4.Important Consideration
- This project runs perfectly on a windows machine by following the steps mentioned in section 3. If want to run on a different OS, encoding might need to be changed.

## 5.Further work to be done
- 1.Planning to give entire PDF with detailed explanation of each and every DL algorithms and their implementation in different sectors. 
- 2.Find a way to showcase all DL algorithms and its type at onestop which helps the DataScience aspirants to get familiar with different DL content (I would be grateful if someone could help me on this, in improving the project for better understanding of DL content).
