## Machine Learning Algorithms

## 1.Introduction
- 1.The term ‘machine learning’ is often, incorrectly, interchanged with Artificial Intelligence, but machine learning is actually a sub field/type of AI. Machine learning is also often referred to as predictive analytics, or predictive modelling.
- 2.Coined by American computer scientist Arthur Samuel in 1959, the term ‘machine learning’ is defined as a “computer’s ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.
- 3.At its most basic, machine learning uses programmed algorithms that receive and analyse input data to predict output values within an acceptable range. As new data is fed to these algorithms, they learn and optimise their operations to improve performance, developing ‘intelligence’ over time.
- 4.There are four types of machine learning algorithms: supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement.

## 2.Objective
- In this project, we are focusing on learning, understanding Machine Laearning and its type practically by implementing them on Jupyter notebook using Python Sckit-learn Machine Learning Package. 

## 3.Steps to execute this Project.
- NOTE:You can go through the each and every ML algorithm and can use or download for your understanding and reference purpose.
- 1.Download/fork/clone the project by clicking [here] (https://github.com/balusena/balugithub/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Algorithms) or just unzip the folder provided.
- 2.Machine_Learning_Algorithms/ directory contains different types of ML algorithms executed notebooks.

## 4.Important Consideration
- This project runs perfectly on a windows machine by following the steps mentioned in section 3. If want to run on a different OS, encoding might need to be changed.

## 5.Further work to be done
- 1.Planning to give entire PDF with detailed explanation of each and every ML algorithms and their implementation in different sectors. 
- 2.Find a way to showcase all ML algorithms and its type at onestop which helps the DataScience aspirants to get familiar with different ML content (I would be grateful if someone could help me on this, in improving the project for better understanding of ML content).
