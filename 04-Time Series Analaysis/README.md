## Time Series Analaysis

## 1.Introduction
- 1.What is Time Series Analysis?
- Time series analysis helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time. Using data visualizations, business users can see seasonal trends and dig deeper into why these trends occur. With modern analytics platforms, these visualizations can go far beyond line graphs.
- In descriptive statistics, a time series is defined as a set of random variables ordered with respect to time. Time series are studied both to interpret a phenomenon, identifying the components of a trend, cyclicity, seasonality and to predict its future values. I think they are the best example of conjunction between the field of Economics and Data Science (stock prices, economic cycles, budgets and cash flows, â€¦).

- 2.What is Time Series Data?
- Time series data, also referred to as time-stamped data, is a sequence of data points indexed in time order. Time-stamped is data collected at different points in time.
- These data points typically consist of successive measurements made from the same source over a time interval and are used to track change over time.

- 3.What are the types of time series classical models?
- The three main types of time series models are moving average, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA. The crucial thing is to choose the right forecasting method as per the characteristics of the time series data. 

- 4.Prerequisites to consider before handling and prcocessing the time series data?
- 4.1.trend analysis to determine whether it is linear or not as most models require this information as input
- 4.2.outliers detection to understand how to spot and handle them
- 4.3.stationarity test to understand if we can assume that the time series is stationary or not
- 4.4.seasonality analysis to determine what is the best seasonal parameter to use when modeling.

## 2.Objective
- In this project, we are trying to cover all the important types of time series techniques and classical models to handle time series data with practical implementation. 

## 3.Steps to execute this Project.
- NOTE:Running the whole project might take an extended period of time. Training time also depends on your system's computation capabilities.
- 1.Download/fork/clone the project by clicking [here] (https://github.com/balusena/balugithub/tree/master/Time_Series_Analaysis) or just unzip the folder provided.

## 4.Important Consideration
- This project runs perfectly on a windows machine by following the steps mentioned in section 3. If want to run on a different OS, encoding might need to be changed.

## 5.Further work to be done
- 1.Need to implement this project further with other different types of time series data and compare the results.
- 2.Planning to build an end-end web based time series stock trend prediction application using the HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT, Flask, or Streamlit using Python and deploy it in Heroku, AWS Platforms. 
- 3.Find a way to cover different important time series analysis that are widely used in real time business(I would be grateful if someone could help me on this, in improving the model for better results).
